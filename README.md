## Guidance from the design team

"Pet images should be displayed on the page as a set of thumbnails; clicking on a thumbnail should display a full-sized image to the user."

"Full-size photos should be able to be closed, and the user should be returned to the thumbnail gallery."

## Requirements from the adoption team

"Furture requirements: They will be partnering with a shelter that has 2000 pets available for adoption. The page should handle that many listings."

"Most people find out about them from internet searches. They need the page to appear towards the top of the search results."
